## **3\. Quick Reference (Daily Cheat Sheet)**

This section provides a quick reference table for core concepts.

### **Part 1: Essential Foundations (C\#, Clean Code, and SOLID)**

| Topic | Practical Summary | Example/Application |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **C\# Modern Features** | Focus on simplifying syntax and ensuring null safety. **Records** for immutable data; **Pattern Matching** for expressive logic; **NRTs** to avoid accidental null. | public record User(int Id, string Name); |
| **C\# Collections** | Understand **List\<T\>**, **Dictionary\<K, V\>** (fast key lookup), and **HashSet\<T\>** (unique elements, O(1) lookup) to optimize data access. | var dict \= new Dictionary\<string, int\>(); |
| **Delegates, Events, Lambdas** | Mechanisms for **async programming** and decoupling. **Lambdas** are anonymous (short) functions representing **Delegates**. | Func\<int, int\> square \= x \=\> x \* x; |
| **POO: Pillars** | **Encapsulation**, **Polymorphism**, **Abstraction**, and **Inheritance**. | Use of private set; and interfaces (IPayment). |
| **POO: Composition vs. Inheritance** | **Composition (Has-a)** is preferred over **Inheritance (Is-a)** for flexibility and avoiding code bloat. | Instead of inheriting Logger, inject it (private readonly ILogger logger;). |
| **S \- Single Responsibility** | A class should have only **one reason to change**. Separate "persists data" logic from "calculates taxes" logic. | OrderService (Business Logic) and OrderRepository (Persistence). |
| **O \- Open/Closed Principle** | Open for **extension**, closed for **modification**. Use Interfaces to add new features without touching existing code. | Create a new class implementing INotificationService instead of editing existing if/else. |
| **D \- Dependency Inversion** | High-level modules should depend on **abstractions** (Interfaces), not concrete implementations. This is the basis of **DI**. | Classes depend on IRepository, not on SqlRepository. |

### **Part 2: API Development (ASP.NET Core, REST, and OpenAPI)**

| Topic | Practical Summary | Example/Application |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Middlewares and Pipeline** | Sequence of components processing HTTP requests. Order is crucial (**Auth** before **Authz**). | app.UseRouting(); app.UseAuthorization(); |
| **Dependency Injection (DI)** | Provides dependencies at runtime. **Transient**, **Scoped** (new per request), **Singleton** (unique per app). | services.AddScoped\<IUserRepository, UserRepository\>(); |
| **RESTful APIs: Principles** | URLs based on **resources** and correct use of **HTTP verbs** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). | GET /api/users/1, POST /api/users |
| **Frontend Connection: CORS** | Browser security mechanism controlling which **origins** can access your API. Must be configured in the Backend. | services.AddCors(options \=\> { options.AddDefaultPolicy(...) }); |

### **Part 3: Data and Quality (SQL Server, EF Core, and Testing)**

| Topic | Practical Summary | Example/Application |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **SQL Server: Indexes** | Structures that speed up data retrieval. **Clustered** (physical order) and **Non-Clustered** (multiple pointers). | Optimize WHERE or JOIN clauses. |
| **Repository Pattern** | Abstraction of data access logic (SQL/EF/Dapper) away from business logic. | IUserRepository.GetById(id) is called in the Service. |
| **TDD (Test-Driven Dev)** | Methodology: **Red** (Failing Test) → **Green** (Pass) → **Refactor** (Improve Code). | Ensures testable and functional code. |
| **Integration Tests** | Validates real communication between components (e.g., Controller \-\> real or in-memory DB). Uses **WebApplicationFactory**. | Ensures the complete API stack works correctly. |

### **Part 4: Architecture, Frontend, and Innovation**

| Topic | Practical Summary | Example/Application |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Clean Architecture** | Dependency Rule: Dependencies must only point **inward**. The Core cannot depend on external frameworks. | The Core (Domain) should not know if the system uses EF Core or MongoDB. |
| **DDD: Aggregates** | Entity groupings treated as a **transactional unit**. Access only through the **Aggregate Root**. | Order (Root) contains the list of OrderItems. |
| **CQRS** | Separating **Command** (write, alters state) and **Query** (read, no state change) models. | Use **MediatR** to route CreateUserCommand and GetUserByIdQuery. |
| **RxJS: Observables** | Asynchronous **data streams** for handling events over time. | httpClient.get('/api/data').subscribe(data \=\> ...) |
| **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** | Integration of **GenAI APIs** into .NET services using **Prompt Engineering** (crafting precise instructions). | Send text to AI API to generate a summary. |

### **Part 5: DevOps, Cloud, and Scalability**

| Topic | Practical Summary | Example/Application |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **CI/CD** | **CI:** Automated Build and Test on commit. **CD:** Automation of Deploy. | **GitHub Actions** or **Azure DevOps Pipeline**. |
| **Containers: Docker** | Packages app and dependencies for reliable deployment ("it works on my machine" \= "it works in production"). | Dockerfile to build the .NET image. |
| **Cloud Computing: PaaS** | **Platform as a Service**. Cloud provider manages OS/runtime. You manage only the code (e.g., Azure App Service). | Host your API in an Azure App Service. |
| **Strategic Caching** | Stores frequently accessed data in a fast layer (e.g., **Redis**) to reduce database load. | Store the User object in Redis for 5 minutes after login. |
| **Performance: Async Optimization** | Use **async/await** to free up server threads during I/O operations (DB calls, HTTP calls). Essential for high scalability. | Maintain the async chain from the Controller to the Repository. |
